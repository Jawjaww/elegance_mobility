   - Document permission structures
   - Update navigation flow diagrams

3. Architecture Documentation
   - Refresh existing documentation
   - Clarify module relationships
   - Review shared component usage
   - Standardize naming patterns

4. Code Refinement
   - Simplify complex implementations
   - Review error handling patterns
   - Validate TypeScript definitions
   - Optimize component structures

5. Repository Management
   - Update documentation

   - Verify documentation accuracy

Optimization Rules:
- NO restructuring of working features
- NO breaking changes to existing flows
- NO removal of essential code
- NO changes without documentation
- NO disruption to current functionality
- NO refactoring without purpose

Apply these guidelines to enhance readability and maintainability while preserving existing functionality across all portals.
